# Phrases (name WIP)
**Description**

Language learning application based on Tim Ferriss' 13 sentences to learn any language.  Users are able to choose from (currently) 10 different languages with the original 13 phrases being automatically populated with romanized and native text translations.  From there, users are able to add variations of the phrases, add completely new phrases with similar functionality, and build their own dictionary of words in the language they would like to learn.  The application allows users to have full control over their language learning experience, rather than relying on a software with predetermined learning paths and vocabulary.  The goal of this approach is to keep users focused on what they are interested in learning and allow for a more disciplined learning experience, without making it feel like a chore.
